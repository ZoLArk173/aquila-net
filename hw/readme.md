This is the hardware source tree of the Aquila SoC.

To create a complete Xilinx Vivado project workspace, simply download the source tree to a local directory, then run the following command under a DOS or Linux console:

```
C:\> <<Vivado Installation directory>>/bin/vivado.bat -mode batch -source build.tcl
```

The created project workspace will be in the directory aquila_soc/. Note that, the tcl script, build.tcl, for project creation was exported from Vivado 2020.2. We have tested the script up to Vivado 2022.1.
